# TweetLinkCollector
Gathers links from chosen twitter profile
The general idea here is that there are people who you follow on twitter whose tweets with links you always want to click, but following all of them and catching all the links is time consuming. Enter this little project where you create a list of people and then ask the program to collect tweets from them.

# Current Limitations (aka. todo's)
1. As I'm writing this project from a mac, it has only been configured for MacOS (Mojave). While there's no specific MacOS limitations in the code, your milage may vary (aka. elaborate way of saying that it worked on my machine).
2. There's a time element missing, currently it's only gathering an amount of tweets (regardless of what's been gathered). Ideally it'll collect up until it last gathered.

# Configuration
You need to create a twitter API and with the four keys create a file called 'credentials.py' and store it in the folder.
